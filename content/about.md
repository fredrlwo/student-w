I'm Fredrik Wollbraaten, a PhD-student in statistics/data science at the Department of Mathematics at the University of Oslo. 

The blog posts will typically be written *while* IÂ´m learning a particular topic, meaning that they should not be taken as an authoritarian source of truth, but suitably correlated with the truth.
