<p>Each year, tens of thousands of Norwegian (and foreign) students apply for admission
to college. Admission is mainly decided by the point score of the students applying to
a particular programme, which is mainly made up by the students grades. As an example, if 1,500 apply to the law programme at the University of Oslo with
230 places, then the top 15.3 % of the students in terms of points are admitted, and the admission cutpoint is the point score of this percentile.</p>
<p>Taking another view, if we consider the population of potential students applying to the programme,
the students with a point score above the <span class="math inline">\(100\times(1500-230)/1500\)</span> or 84.7-th percentile are admitted.</p>
<p>After the application season is over, the admission cutpoints for each programme is published, in addition to the total number of applicants and available positions.</p>

<h1>A model for the admission cutpoint</h1>
<p>Given the three datapoints</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Admission cutpoint</em> <span class="math inline">\(c_t\)</span></li>
<li><em>Applicants</em> <span class="math inline">\(a_t\)</span></li>
<li><em>Available seats</em> <span class="math inline">\(s_t\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>for years <span class="math inline">\(t = 1, ..., T\)</span>, we can think about how we can model the admission cutpoint given
the number of applicants <span class="math inline">\(a_t\)</span> and available seats <span class="math inline">\(s_t\)</span> in a given year. Usually, thinking about the process generating the data is a fruitful approach. In this case, we can assume that we have some population of applicants for a particular programme in year <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, parameterised by <span class="math inline">\(\theta_t\)</span>. Then, the admission cutpoint is generated by drawing <span class="math inline">\(a_t\)</span> applicants from this distribution, and calculating <span class="math inline">\(c_t = (a_t - s_t)/a_t\)</span>-quantile. While this process makes sense, actually formulating the likelihood of the parameters <span class="math inline">\(\theta_t\)</span> given the cutpoints <span class="math inline">\(c_1, ..., c_T\)</span> is rather difficult (at least for me, it seems like this needs marginalizing out all individual applicants scoresâ€¦)</p>
<p>However, there actually exists methods for estimating the posterior distribution <span class="math inline">\(p(\theta|C)\)</span> in settings where the likelihood is difficult/impossible to formulate or evaluation is computationally intensive. In this post I will explore <em>Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)</em> to approximate <span class="math inline">\(p(\theta|C)\)</span> for the admission cutpoints.</p>
