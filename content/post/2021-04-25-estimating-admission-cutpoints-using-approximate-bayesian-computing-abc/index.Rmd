Each year, tens of thousands of Norwegian (and foreign) students apply for admission 
to college. Admission is mainly decided by the point score of the students applying to 
a particular programme, which is mainly made up by the students grades. As an example, if 1,500 apply to the law programme at the University of Oslo with 
230 places, then the top `r round(100*230/1500, 1)` % of the students in terms of points are admitted, and the admission cutpoint is the point score of this percentile. 

Taking another view, if we consider the population of potential students applying to the programme, 
the students with a point score above the $100\times(1500-230)/1500$ or `r round(100*(1500-230)/1500, 1)`-th percentile are admitted.

After the application season is over, the admission cutpoints for each programme is published, in addition to the total number of applicants and available positions. 

# A model for the admission cutpoint

Given the three datapoints 

* *Admission cutpoint* $c_t$
* *Applicants* $a_t$
* *Available seats* $s_t$

for years $t = 1, ..., T$, we can think about how we can model the admission cutpoint given 
the number of applicants $a_t$ and available seats $s_t$ in a given year. Usually, thinking about the process generating the data is a fruitful approach. In this case, we can assume that we have some population of applicants for a particular programme in year $t$, parameterised by $\theta_t$. Then, the admission cutpoint is generated by drawing $a_t$ applicants from this distribution, and calculating $c_t = (a_t - s_t)/a_t$-quantile. While this process makes sense, actually formulating the likelihood of the parameters $\theta_t$ given the cutpoints $c_1, ..., c_T$ is rather difficult (at least for me, it seems like this needs marginalizing out all individual applicants scores...)

However, there actually exists methods for estimating the posterior distribution $p(\theta|C)$ in settings where the likelihood is difficult/impossible to formulate or evaluation is computationally intensive. In this post I will explore *Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)* to approximate $p(\theta|C)$ for the admission cutpoints.
